# TradeBotApp
Every 3.5 seconds, takes 10 newest offers from the market and picks the one with the best discount,
then compares it to the offers of the same item. If the offer is 15% cheaper than the lowest-priced item, the offer parameter is saved to a text file.

 Before you run app you have to add a path for your txt file and  swap PRIVATE_KEY and PUBLIC_KEY to your own. Keys in code are expired.
